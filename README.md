# 🌾 Kenya Climate–WeFarm Analysis (DataKind Volunteer Project)

This repository explores the relationship between **climate conditions** and **farmer communication behavior** using data from **WeFarm** and the **World Bank Climate Knowledge Portal**.  
The goal is to understand how rainfall and temperature patterns influence the types and frequency of farmer questions.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
This analysis focuses on smallholder farmers in Kenya and examines:
- How monthly **rainfall** and **temperature** affect farmer engagement.
- What **topics** farmers discuss most during specific seasons (pests, irrigation, soil, etc.).
- How **data science** and **NLP** can guide better agricultural decision-making.

---

## 🔍 Methodology
- **Data Cleaning & Integration:** Combined World Bank climate data with WeFarm questions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Monthly trends, rainfall correlations.
- **Topic Modeling (LDA):** Identified discussion themes automatically from question text.
- **Visualization:** Showed seasonal topic variation and weather–behavior correlations.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Rainy seasons bring spikes in pest and planting-related questions.
- Dry periods shift interest toward irrigation and soil management.
- Farmers’ digital behavior can predict upcoming agricultural challenges.
